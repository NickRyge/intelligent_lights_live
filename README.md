# Intelligent light

This repo is for an unreleased BeamNG.drive mod that implements never before seen intelligently movable headlights. 

The in-game default headlight flares and cookies are not particularly impressive. It looks like someone strapped a flashlight to either side of the car using off-brand duct tape. A mod to remidy that already exists however, and this mod does not just focus on adding realistic headlights. This mod instead focuses on implementing intelligent headlight functionality such as cornering lights as seen on Volvo and Mercedes vehicles, which curve with the road and always points to where the driver is looking - And intelligent high beams that avoid oncomming cars, creating a black spot right where it is. 

This mod adds intelligent headlights to the ETK800 series of vehicles.
